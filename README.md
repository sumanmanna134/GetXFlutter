# getxmode

**GetX allows the total decoupling of the View,  
presentation logic, business logic, dependency injection,  
and navigation. You do not need context to navigate between routes,  
so you are not dependent on the widget tree (visualization) for this**.

## Getting Started


`git clone https://github.com/sumanmanna134/GetXFlutter.git`

### for web:
`flutter channel beta`
`flutter upgrade`
`flutter config --enable-web`

#### for existing project:
`flutter create .`
#### To serve your app from localhost in Chrome, enter the following from the top of the package:
`flutter run -d chrome`
